How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Only one had the error

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easier to find where bugs were introduced

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros - versions make sense
    cons - can choose to not do it often enough

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    One logical change can imply related changes in multiple files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    See the logical change in the log, compare the version with the logical change of interest to the previous version with diff.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always get back to a working version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
