What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git directory is created so git can store all its data when things actually get
committed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

working directory has all files, whether they are being tracked by git or not
repository has all files that have been committed
staging area has files being tracked that may or may not have been committed
